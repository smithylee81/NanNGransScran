# User Story Testing

## As a family visitor to the website, I want to know what I can do on the website, navigate with ease using a clearly defined navigaiton bar and understand how to register an account.

**Acceptance Criteria:** Users must be able to understand the websites purpose on first visit and easily see where to register.

**Summary:**

- When the user visits the website, they are presented with a **Logo & Hero Image** containing a self-descriptive name and vintage image of an elderly lady holding a spoon.
- The **NavBar** is positioned at the top of the page, and is therefore familiar and easy to identify.
- When a user first visits the website, they are presented with a title and short description, an 'About section' which provides them with an understanding of the reason for the development of the site and awareness that they can also share their recipes on the site.
- The **NavBar** provides a clear indication of the next steps. 
- It is therefore clear, from first visit, the name and purpose of the website.

**Outcome: Pass**

## As a potential user, I want the usage to be either self-descriptive or the instructions clearly communicated, so that I can interact with the site with ease.

**Acceptance Criteria**: A user should be able to understand how to both navigate and interact with the website and its features, either through design, implementation or through instructions.

**Summary:**
