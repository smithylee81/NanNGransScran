## About

A Homemade Recipe website designed for the purposes of the family to visit, see other family members recipes, search recipes and create new recipes sharing their own knowledge of the family’s history of ‘gid auld hame cookin’. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a wide range of devices, making it easy for everyone to access and use whether they're on the go or sitting at a desktop.

I created the site to look vintage and homely using an earthy colour scheme, with varied colours of brown and cream, to bring a warm and comforting feel, in keeping with a family orientated & vintage theme.

## **Design Choices**


### **Fonts**

### **Colours**

As the site purpose is about keeping the family history alive the colour scheme used is adapted to suit a vintage and nurturing feel. “In branding and marketing, brown is associated with reliability, dependability, and nurturing. Popular brands that use brown in their logos and marketing include UPS, Hershey's, Cotton, Edy's, J.P. Morgan, and M&Ms.” ( ‘verywellmind’) [https://www.verywellmind.com/the-color-psychology-of-brown]


It features complementary greys and browns that stand out to make the content easy to read. 

The colours chosen are:

![Coolors Palette](static/assets/img/portfolio/CoolorsPic.png)


Format: [Coolors Palette]( https://coolors.co/palette/cb997e-ddbea9-ffe8d6-b7b7a4-a5a58d-6b705c)

These colours complement each other well and are not too striking, in keeping with what the user expects from the vintage feel. 


### **Imagery**

Images feature a vintage image of a Grandmother tasting a recipe and images of food include Soup for entering into the ‘Soup’ recipes, an image of Cheese and Wine for the ‘Starters’ recipes, a Chicken Dish for the ‘Mains’ recipes and Chocolate Cake for the ‘Puddings’ recipes. 
Most of the images have been sourced from [Free PNGs]( https://www.freepngs.com) and are free to use. 
The types of images chosen showcase the themes for each recipe category and hopefully provide the user with an intuitive experience. 


### **Wireframes**

Wireframes were hand drawn and can be found in pdf form in [wireframes](static/assets/wireframes)

## **Features**

### **Features Implemented**

Features relevant to all pages:

    - Navigation links collapse into a menu button on mobile and tablet view for an easy user experience. 
    - The colour scheme is designed to be vintage and easy to read with the contrast tested on Google Dev Tools to preview.

- I would also like to add an option for an alert to other users when a new recipe has been added. 


### **Responsive Design**

- Bootstrap & Startbootstrap were used to make the site responsive on all devices.

## **Deployment**

## How this project was Developed and Deployed

The project was developed using [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/), pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and deployed to Heroku via the following steps:



### Initial Deployment

- Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- [Log in](https://id.heroku.com/login) or [Sign Up](https://signup.heroku.com/) for an account.
  - If Creating an account, select **Python** as the Primary development language.
  - Activate the account via the confirmation email.
  - Accept the Terms of Service.
- Click on **Create new app**.
- Enter a suitable **App Name** and **Region**.
- Click **Create App**.
- Under the **Deploy** tab, under the heading **Deployment Method**, click the **GitHub** icon, and proceed to click the button which states **Connect to GitHub**.
- Enter your credentials for **GitHub.**
- Search for the repository required (in this instance, **Nan n Gran's Scran**), and click **Connect.**

### Automatic Deployment

This project was set up to automatically re-deploy with any changes made to the Master Branch. The following steps were taken to enable this.

- Navigate to the **Automatic deploys** section within the **Deploy** tab.
- Select the **branch** you would like to link to automatic deployment.
  - As stated above, the `main` branch was chosen for automatic deployment.
- Click **Enable Automatic Deploys**.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set within your Heroku Server for the site to deploy and function correctly. Navigate to the **Settings** tab, and under the heading **Config Vars**, select **Reveal Config Vars,** and add the following variables:

- **IP** : 0.0.0.0
- **PORT** : 5000
- **MONGO_URI**
  - This variable can be obtained from **MongoDB** through the following steps:
  - Log in to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2).
  - Under **Data Storage** click on **Clusters**.
  - For the Cluster that you would like to connect to, click the **Connect** button.
  - Click on **Connect your Application.**
  - Select **Python**, and Version **3.6 or Later.**
  - Copy the connection string, replacing `<password>` with your MongoDB password, and `myFirstDatabase` with the name of the **MongoDB Collection** (Database) you would like to connect to.
- **MONGO_DBNAME**
  - The name of the Database you are connecting to (in the above example, the default would be `myFirstDatabase`.
- **SECRET_KEY**
  - A random sequence of characters, required for maintaining session security in Flask. One method of obtaining a Secret Key is through [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/).


### Environment Variables

- When running this project locally, the **Environment Variables** must be set in order for it to function as intended.
- Once you have completed any of the upcoming steps to run/deploy the project in your browser or locally, please create a new python file in your root directory called [**envy.py**](https://pypi.org/project/env.py/).
- Within this file, declare the environment variables described above, in the following format, replacing the `<variable>` with the required variables:

```python
import os
os.environ.setdefault("IP", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("GMAPS_API", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("GMAPS_ID", "<variable> ")
```

The project will automatically locate this file, and read the required environment variables as and when necessary. This file has not been included within the repo due to the security implications.
