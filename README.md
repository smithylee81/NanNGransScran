## About

A Homemade Recipe website designed for the purposes of the family to visit, see other family members recipes, search recipes and create new recipes sharing their own knowledge of the family’s history of ‘gid auld hame cookin’. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a wide range of devices, making it easy for everyone to access and use whether they're on the go or sitting at a desktop.

I created the site to look vintage and homely using an earthy colour scheme, with varied colours of brown and cream, to bring a warm and comforting feel, in keeping with a family orientated & vintage theme.

## **Design Choices**

### **Fonts**

I wanted to create a vintage look and therfore utilised the 'Vintage Party' from 'CDN Fonts' ['http://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/vintage-party'], with 'sans-serif' as a back-up font;

### **Colours**

As the site purpose is about keeping the family history alive the colour scheme used is adapted to suit a vintage and nurturing feel. “In branding and marketing, brown is associated with reliability, dependability, and nurturing. Popular brands that use brown in their logos and marketing include UPS, Hershey's, Cotton, Edy's, J.P. Morgan, and M&Ms.” ( ‘verywellmind’) [https://www.verywellmind.com/the-color-psychology-of-brown]


It features complementary greys and browns that stand out to make the content easy to read. 

The colours chosen are:

![Coolors Palette](static/assets/img/portfolio/CoolorsPic.png)


Format: [Coolors Palette]( https://coolors.co/palette/cb997e-ddbea9-ffe8d6-b7b7a4-a5a58d-6b705c)

These colours complement each other well and are not too striking, in keeping with what the user expects from the vintage feel. 


### **Imagery**

Images feature vintage & retro pictures to keep the theme, with main background image on home page of a Grandmother tasting a recipe and relevant images of food courses throughout the website.  

Images have been sourced from a variety of sites with free use:

## **Features**

### **Features Implemented**

Features relevant to all pages:
- **base.html - Header & Footer**
    - Contains navigation links and is fixed to the top of the page for easy use on all devices (this was done using a Bootstrap 5 NavBar). 
    - Both the Home link and Title Logo provide navigation back to the Home page for ease of use and return to the main home page.
    - Navigation links collapse into a hamburger menu button on mobile and tablet view for an easy user experience. 
    - The colour scheme is designed to be vintage and easy to read with the contrast tested on Google Dev Tools to preview.

- **Footer** 
    - Designed to sit at the bottom of the page after all of the content 
    - Contains social media links to the Developer’s GitHub repository and links to Facebook, Discord and LinkedIn. 


- **Register Form**
    - For the user to register their name & email address to provide Log In details and their own profile/account. Fields: Name, Email and Password are required and display an error message if not filled in when selecting submit. 


    ### **Future Features**
- I would like to add a section where the family can view the handwritten recipe pages that Nanna & Gran wrote personally, time constraints impacted this.
- I would also like to add an option for an alert to other users when a new recipe has been added so that they can go onto the app and view this is they wish. 
- I would have liked to have successfully created a python function and appropriate syntax to enable the upload of an image by the user before final deployment and submission, however my attempts were unsuccessful to date.
- I would have liked to have utilised the 'created_by' section with a feature to allow edit and delete of the users own created recipes ONLY, time constraints impacted on same.
- I would also like to utilise the 'search' bar in future development for users to find what they are looking for quicker and easier. The search fields are present on NavBar but have not been 'wired up' to the app.py with an appropriate function as yet.
- I would like the Profile page to be built out more with facility to upload an image to this section for a more personalised user feel.
- I would also like to utilise a 'star ratings' feature for the family to rate the recipes.
- I would also like a 'favorites' selection to be implemented and enabled which displays on the users profile.

### Initial Deployment

- Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- [Log in](https://id.heroku.com/login) or [Sign Up](https://signup.heroku.com/) for an account.
  - If Creating an account, select **Python** as the Primary development language.
  - Activate the account via the confirmation email.

- Click on **Create new app**.
- Enter a suitable **App Name** and **Region**.
- Click **Create App**.
- Under the **Deploy** tab, under the heading **Deployment Method**, click the **GitHub** icon, and proceed to click the button which states **Connect to GitHub**.
- Enter your credentials for **GitHub.**
- Search for the repository required (in this instance, **Nan n Gran's Scran**), and click **Connect.**

### Automatic Deployment

This project was set up to automatically re-deploy with any changes made to the Master Branch. The following steps were taken to enable this.

- Navigate to the **Automatic deploys** section within the **Deploy** tab.
- Select the **branch** you would like to link to automatic deployment.
  - As stated above, the `main` branch was chosen for automatic deployment.
- Click **Enable Automatic Deploys**.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set within your Heroku Server for the site to deploy and function correctly. Navigate to the **Settings** tab, and under the heading **Config Vars**, select **Reveal Config Vars,** and add the following variables:

- **IP** : 0.0.0.0
- **PORT** : 5000
- **MONGO_URI**
  - This variable can be obtained from **MongoDB** through the following steps:
  - Log in to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2).
  - Under **Data Storage** click on **Clusters**.
  - For the Cluster that you would like to connect to, click the **Connect** button.
  - Click on **Connect your Application.**
  - Select **Python**, and Version **3.6 or Later.**
  - Copy the connection string, replacing `<password>` with your MongoDB password, and `myFirstDatabase` with the name of the **MongoDB Collection** (Database) you would like to connect to.
- **MONGO_DBNAME**
  - The name of the Database you are connecting to (in the above example, the default would be `myFirstDatabase`.
- **SECRET_KEY**
  - A random sequence of characters, required for maintaining session security in Flask. One method of obtaining a Secret Key is through [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/).


### Environment Variables

- When running this project locally, the **Environment Variables** must be set in order for it to function as intended.
- Once you have completed any of the upcoming steps to run/deploy the project in your browser or locally, please create a new python file in your root directory called [**envy.py**](https://pypi.org/project/env.py/).
- Within this file, declare the environment variables described above, in the following format, replacing the `<variable>` with the required variables:

```python
import os
os.environ.setdefault("IP", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("GMAPS_API", "<variable>")
os.environ.setdefault("GMAPS_ID", "<variable> ")
```

The project will automatically locate this file, and read the required environment variables as and when necessary. This file has not been included within the repo due to the security implications.
